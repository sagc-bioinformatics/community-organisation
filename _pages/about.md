## About this site

We are maintain this website as a centralised resource for the Adelaide Bioinformatics workshop programme.
In the future we expect the workshops to continue under the umbrella of the Adelaide ABACBS node,
with continued support from the institutions and service providers that have all contributed to support our talented
students and researchers.
